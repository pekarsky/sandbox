Just a bunch of different projects, created during S..r interview preparation - Kafka/Docker/k8s

1. democonsumer/demoproducer - simple kafka producer/consumer
2. request-reply-web/request-replay-processor - kafka communication with answer
3. frontend/simpleapp - Docker, k8s - deployment/service/discovery/properties

NB: it is just prototyping. I know, that put spring boot application, configuration and controller to a single class is a bad idea.
